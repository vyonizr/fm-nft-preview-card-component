## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

To center an absolute element with Tailwind CSS, add the following classes:

```
absolute top-1/2 left-1/2 z-20 -translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-1/2 transform
```

### Useful resources

- [Handling Hover, Focus, and Other States](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states) - This helped me grouping active states with Tailwind CSS.
